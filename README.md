__**Hello!**__

__Just a few notes here:__

- 1. I used venv to create a virtual environment.
- 2. I used cx_freeze and PyInstaller to convert the scripts into an exe.
- 3. This took far too long to make.
- 4. The download link for the installer is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xcO6jQWrhj2QDENSSROLMK0E4vLbW-Bp/view?usp=sharing)

__I'll probably add more notes at a later time.__
